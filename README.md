# 📝 SVG-Note

**SVG-Note** is an experimental note-taking web app where **SVG images** are used as the database.
Each note is stored as an SVG element, making the database itself also a visual representation of your notes.
This project explores the intersection of **data storage** and **visualization** in a playful way.

---

## ✨ Features
- Create, read, update, and delete notes stored inside an SVG file.
- Notes are represented as SVG elements (text, shapes, or metadata).
- Experimental approach: your database is also a graph-like, colorful visualization.
- Built with **NestJS** for a clean and modular backend structure.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** NestJS
- **Database:** SVG (XML file with embedded notes)

(Frontend TBD – could be plain EJS templates or React for a richer UI)
